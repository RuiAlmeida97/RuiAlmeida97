### Hello everyone 👋

I am a Junior Data Analyst with a passion for using data to solve complex problems and drive business growth. With a background in Hospitality Management and Management, I bring a unique perspective to data analysis that combines a deep understanding of customer service and financial management with a data-driven approach.

I recently completed a course in Data Analytics and am excited to apply my new skills and knowledge to real-world business challenges. My guiding principles are honesty, ethics, and a commitment to making a positive impact through my work.

In addition to my data analysis skills, I have a strong interest in sports, particularly football, as well as astronomy and politics. I am always eager to learn more and expand my knowledge in these areas.

I am currently seeking opportunities to work with a company that values innovation, teamwork, and continuous learning. I believe that my background in Hospitality Management and Management, combined with my newly acquired data analytics skills, make me a valuable asset to any team.
